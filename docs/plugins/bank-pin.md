# Bank PIN

The Bank PIN plugin provides some QOL changes in the game when you are entering your bank PIN. You can turn any of these on or off in the plugin configuration.

## Configuration

### Auto Enter PIN

When enabled, the plugin will type in your PIN for you when the bank PIN screen comes up.

You will need to also enable the Keyboard Bankpin in the Bank plugin for this to work.

### Highlight Next Digit

When enabled, an overlay will show on top of the next button you need to click when entering your PIN.

If you manually click the buttons to enter your PIN instead of typing it this can save you a lot of time.

### PIN

This is where you actually enter your bank PIN. The rest of the plugin relies on this value so if it is not set or it is incorrect the rest of the plugin may not work properly.

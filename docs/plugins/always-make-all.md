# Always Make All

The Always Make All plugin automatically selects the `All` option in the multi-skill menus that are used during fletching, herblore, etc. If there is only one thing that can be made, it the plugin automatically selects that item to start creating the items with no additional clicks required from the player.

If the `All` option is not available in the menu (e.g. when combining arrow shafts and feathers you can make at most 10 at a time), the plugin will instead select the largest quantity that can be made.
